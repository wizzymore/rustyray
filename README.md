[raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming.

This crate is a high-level wrapper on top of [rustyray-sys](https://github.com/wizzymore/rustyray/tree/master/rustyray-sys).

The motivation behind this project is to have as safe and performant of an implementation of raylib in rust as possible.

### Usage

Add it to your project:

```shell
cargo add rustyray
```

### Examples

See [examples](https://github.com/wizzymore/rustyray/tree/master/rustyray/examples).

I will try to re-create all raylib examples.

### Contributing

PRs and issues are not welcome yet, the crate is work in progress and until version 1.0.0 i don't recommend to anyone to use this.
